# Bujurg Mitra – Smart Elder Care Platform

**Bujurg Mitra** (Hindi: *Elder’s Friend*) is a smart elder-care system designed to improve safety, independence, and peace of mind for elderly people living alone or with limited supervision.

This project showcases a prototype that integrates wearable devices, IoT sensors, and intuitive interfaces to monitor health and safety in real time.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Elderly individuals often face delayed emergency responses due to lack of real-time monitoring, especially when living alone. Traditional care systems are either manual or expensive. Bujurg Mitra aims to solve this through an affordable technology-driven solution.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Wearable devices (e.g., smartwatch, wristband) collect movement/health data  
2. Sensors send data to the main monitoring system  
3. Algorithm detects abnormal patterns (e.g., falls)  
4. Sends alerts to family/caregivers

*(Note: This repo contains frontend prototypes and sample simulation screens.)*
